# Django-orders

This is simple Django Project which consists of the following:
- Models: OrderItem, Customers, IOrder (combine the customers and their ordered items)
- Admin Panel: Each of the models are registered in the Admin Panel, however the IOrder model is elaborated so it is possible to filter the values based on such parameters as "domestic" (vs "international") and "This Year Customers" (vs all)
